You are analyzing feedback given to a student for an essay they wrote.

**Your objectives**:  
1. Identify the student's strengths and weaknesses across specific skill categories.  
2. Find the top three recurring mistakes made in the essay.  

---

### Input Format  
- The variable **processedOutputAI** is a JSON array containing sub-arrays.  
- Each sub-array has two elements:  
  1. A label describing the type of feedback.  
  2. The feedback content itself.  

- Feedback content may include HTML line breaks (<br>) â€” treat these as normal newlines for formatting.  

- For feedback types labeled **"Spelling Errors and Unclear Handwriting"**, **"Grammar and Sentence Structure"**, **"Improvements"**, and **"Errors"**, each feedback entry contains three keys:  
  - **Index**: The referenced line number in the original essay.  
  - **Original**: The original student text.  
  - **Feedback**: The comment or correction related to that text.
